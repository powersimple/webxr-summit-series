At DreamWorks he managed key innovation, development and integration of the Academy award-winning \"Shrek\" facial system, adapting it to DreamWorks' animated features franchise pipeline. By enabling animators to convey emotions through facial expressions as never before, the Shrek facial system, was the breakthrough that allowed Shrek to be the first computer- animated film ever to put digital human characters in leading roles, leading it to become the highest- grossing animated franchise of all times, with over $3.5B in revenues. In 2006, Haggai launched a tech startup out of M.I.T focused on the innovation of the next generation natural human interface for the Metaverse. His innovation lab created key technologies and XR experiences that preceded commercial VR headsets including avatar interaction, head, facial and eye tracking, gestural and haptic. At Microsoft Haggai led Mixed Reality (MR) initiatives and R&amp;D prototyping on HoloLens including the first shareable HoloLens Mixed Reality experience development at Microsoft which preceded \u201cMesh\u201d. Most recently Haggai led XR strategy at Meta driving global XR initiatives, partnerships and teams in NA, APAC and EMEA. Notably, he produced and oversaw the creation and deployment for the first WebXR\/OpenXR project, Project Origami: \u201cThe Magic of Flight\u201d.

Given the intersection of AR\/VR with neuroscience, Rolando\u2019s recent interests revolve around how we can shape a future internet to be more human-centered and grounded under ethical principles. He recently directed a cinematic educational video on the history of the Metaverse and its ongoing issues with privacy and agency. The video can be found here: https:\/\/youtu.be\/wsJF1ugsfKI\n\nRolando graduated from Yale University with a focus on Molecular, Cellular and Developmental Biology. During his studies co-founded Shuflix with his brothers, the largest activity search engine (at the time), to help people interact with their environment in a playful alternative way while helping small businesses get more exposure. Since then, he has also co-founded PhDx, a platform to help incoming PhD students with guides and insider knowledge of the unspoken rules in academia.\n\nIn his free time, Rolando is a filmmaker, composes for films, creates augmented reality tutorials for his YouTube channel, and does pro-bono marketing consulting for personal brands and small businesses.","attr":"Teleprompter","url":"\/profile\/rolando-masis-obando\/","slug":"rolando-masis-obando","coords":"","offset":"x_-0.077 y_-0.116","post_parent":0,"classes":"","description":"","target":"","xfn":""},{"ID":6020,"object":"profile","object_id":"6017","menu_item_parent":"0","menu_order":19,"title":"John Sidorovich","content":"","attr":"Music by","url":"\/profile\/john-sidorovich\/","slug":"john-sidorovich","coords":"","offset":"x_0.194 y_-0.120","post_parent":0,"classes":"","description":"","target":"","xfn":""},{"ID":5988,"object":"profile","object_id":"592","menu_item_parent":"0","menu_order":20,"title":"Linda Ricci","content":"","attr":"Poly Trophy Designed By:","url":"\/profile\/linda-ricci\/","slug":"linda-ricci","coords":"","offset":"x_0.047 y_-0.338","post_parent":0,"classes":"","description":"","target":"","xfn":""},{"ID":5894,"object":"profile","object_id":"5780","menu_item_parent":"0","menu_order":21,"title":"Looking Glass","content":"","attr":"Poly Trophies Enshrined in:","url":"\/profile\/looking-glass\/","slug":"looking-glass","coords":"","offset":"","post_parent":0,"classes":"","description":"","target":"","xfn":""},{"ID":5895,"object":"profile","object_id":"848","menu_item_parent":"5894","menu_order":22,"title":"Shawn Frayne","content":"\u003C!-- wp:paragraph --\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EInspired by movies in the 80\u2019s and 90\u2019s, Shawn has been reaching towards the dream of the hologram for over 20 years.
